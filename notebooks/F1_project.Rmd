```{r}

List of circuits and races (historical - present):

```{r}
circuits <- read.csv('../data/f1db_csv/circuits.csv') |> 
  select(-url) |> 
  rename(circuitName = name)
races <- read.csv('../data/f1db_csv/races.csv') |> 
  select(!(url:sprint_time)) |> 
  rename(GPname = name, startTime = time)
```

Merging circuits and races:

```{r}
races_df <- full_join(races, circuits, by = join_by(circuitId))
```

```{r}
races_2024 <- races_df |> 
  filter(year == 2024)
```

Race results:

```{r}
results <- read.csv('../data/f1db_csv/results.csv')
status <- read.csv('../data/f1db_csv/status.csv')
drivers <- read.csv('../data/f1db_csv/drivers.csv')
constructors <- read.csv('../data/f1db_csv/constructors.csv')
qualifying <- read.csv('../data/f1db_csv/qualifying.csv')
```

Merge results and status, drivers, and constuctors (to add names to numbers):

```{r}
results_df <- left_join(results, status, by = join_by(statusId))
```

```{r}
results_df <- left_join(results_df, races, by = join_by(raceId))
```

Reliability trend over the years (using percentage of cars that finished (/did not retire) in the race):

```{r}
results_df |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarise(finishPercentage = (sum(positionText != 'R'))/(n=n())) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=finishPercentage)) +
  geom_line()
```

Winning percentage:

```{r}
results_df <- left_join(results_df, constructors, by = join_by(constructorId)) |> 
  select(!(nationality:url))
```

```{r}
winning_percentage <- results_df |> 
  group_by(year, constructorRef) |> 
  summarise(winPercentage = (sum(positionText == '1'))/(n=n()/2))
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
