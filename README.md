# F1 Project
## 

I have been watching Formula 1 since childhood, so you can say that it's a pretty big part of my life - we live in different states so we can't watch it together anymore, so instead, my dad and I have Sunday afternoon post-race debriefs (and occasionally talk about other subjects). Therefore, I was very motivated to find something F1-adjacent for the mid-term project.
Modern F1 is highly data-driven: everything from lap times to the *exact* point on the lap where a driver accelerates or brakes is monitored and analysed. Teams rely a lot on gathered data and simulator testing as:
 - Track time is extremely limited (3 days of pre-season testing and 1-3 non-competitive ‘Free Practice’ sessions per race weekend)
 - Cost caps mean that teams have to be smart about developing and implementing upgrades

For this project, I'm focusing on less-granular data, looking rather at broader historical trends.
